Explination of commands

==== Overview ====
Commands
1. create
2. add
3. post
4. display
5. server


==== note ====
To allow for spaces in usernames, "," are used to space out inputs for all commands
(i.e.) create,john smith


==== create ====
To create a new user simply input the create command followed by ",". (no space). this allows
you to have a space within your username. Another note, do not add "" quotation marks unless you want quotation marks in your name. 


==== add ====
This adds a user to someones friend list, simply type add,first user,seccond user.
this function is carried out twice so two repsonses are given, this is to make friendship 
symmetrical.


==== post ====
Here we can use post to type to another users' wall, simply input
(post,sender,receiver,then any sentence you want to post to the wall).
Do not add "" quotation marks unless you want quotation marks in your sentence.


==== display ====
Finally this command allows for a users wall to be displayed
(i.e.) display,john smith


==== exit ====
This final command isn't one used often and was used for ease of access,
simply type "exit" to leave the server, [ ctrl + c ] also works.
